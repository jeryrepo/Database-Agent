# Natural Language Database Agent with Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an intelligent agent that connects directly to a database and generates interactive dashboards. The key feature is that **you don’t need to know SQL** — simply type your request in plain English, and within seconds, a complete dashboard will appear.

## Features
- **Natural Language Queries**: Write in normal English, no SQL required.  
- **Instant Dashboards**: Get a fully functional dashboard in seconds.  
- **Database Integration**: Connects seamlessly with your database.  
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for non-technical users who want insights without coding.  

## How It Works
1. The agent receives a query written in plain English.  
2. It translates the query into optimized SQL commands.  
3. Results are processed and visualized into a dashboard automatically.  

## Example
- Input: *"Show me sales by region for the last 6 months"*  
- Output: A dashboard with charts and tables displaying sales trends by region.  

## Use Cases
- Business teams who want quick insights without technical expertise.  
- Analysts who need rapid prototyping of dashboards.  
- Startups and organizations looking to democratize data access.
